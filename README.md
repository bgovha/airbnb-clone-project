## Database Design
The database is a relational model built with PostgreSQL, designed to manage users, property listings, bookings, reviews, and payments efficiently.

**Key Entities & Relationships**
**Users**

* id (Primary Key)

* username

* email

* password_hash

* phone_number

**Relationships:** A User can have multiple Properties (as a Host) and multiple Bookings (as a Guest).

**Properties**

* id (Primary Key)

* title

* description

* price_per_night

* host_id (Foreign Key to Users)

**Relationships:** A Property belongs to one User (the host). A Property can have many Bookings and many Reviews.

**Bookings**

* id (Primary Key)

* check_in_date

* check_out_date

* total_price

* guest_id (Foreign Key to Users)

* property_id (Foreign Key to Properties)

**Relationships:** A Booking belongs to one User (the guest) and one Property.

**Reviews**

* id (Primary Key)

* rating

* comment

* booking_id (Foreign Key to Bookings)

* guest_id (Foreign Key to Users)

**Relationships:** A Review is created for one Booking, written by the User (guest) who made that booking.

**Payments**

* id (Primary Key)

* amount

* status (e.g., pending, completed, failed)

* booking_id (Foreign Key to Bookings)

* payment_intent_id (from Stripe/Paypal)

* Relationships: A Payment is associated with one Booking.

## ‚ú® Feature Breakdown
The backend provides a robust set of features for a full-featured booking platform:

**üìö Comprehensive APIs:** Fully documented RESTful APIs (OpenAPI standard) and a flexible GraphQL endpoint for efficient data querying.

**üîê User Authentication:** Secure user registration, login, and profile management.

**üè† Property Management:** Full CRUD operations for creating, viewing, updating, and deleting property listings.

**üìÖ Booking System:** Create and manage reservations with check-in/check-out functionality.

**üí≥ Payment Processing:** Integrated endpoints to securely handle booking transactions.

**‚≠ê Review System:** Post and manage user reviews for properties.

**üöÄ Performance Optimizations:** Database indexing and caching strategies ensure fast response times and scalability.

üîí API Security
Securing our APIs is paramount to protecting user data, ensuring privacy, and maintaining the integrity of our platform. We implement a multi-layered security approach.

## Key Security Measures
**Authentication (JWT Tokens):** 
* Verify user identity. 
Users must log in to receive a secure token, which must be included in subsequent requests to access protected endpoints.

**Authorization (Role-Based Access Control):** 
* Control user permissions. 
Authenticated users are only allowed to perform actions specific to their role (e.g., a user can edit their own profile but not another user's).

**Data Validation & Sanitization:** 
* Prevent injection attacks. 
All input data is rigorously validated and sanitized on the server-side to protect against SQL injection, XSS, and other common vulnerabilities.

**Rate Limiting:** 
* Protect against abuse and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. 
We limit the number of requests a user can make to our API within a specific timeframe.

**HTTPS Encryption:** 
* Encrypt all data in transit. 
This ensures that all communication between the client and server is encrypted, protecting sensitive information like passwords and payment details.

**Security by Feature Area**
**Feature Area**	            **Security Importance**	                            **Key Measures**
User Authentication	            Protects user accounts from unauthorized access.	JWT tokens, hashed passwords, secure session management.
User & Property Data	        Ensures privacy and prevents data breaches.	        Authorization, input validation, HTTPS encryption.
Payment Processing	Critical.   Protects financial data and prevents fraud.	        HTTPS, integration with PCI-compliant payment gateways, never storing raw payment details.
Booking System	                Prevents fraudulent bookings and ensures fairness.	Authorization so users can only manage their own bookings.
Review System	                Maintains system integrity and prevents spam.	    Authentication, rate limiting, input sanitization.
